  description: "Enter a pattern into an 11x11 grid based on its color. With over 150
    patterns and 16 unique colors and solving methods, this module is a lot to take
    in. Trust me.\r\n\r\nEstimated Difficulty: 6/10 (defuser and expert)\r\n\r\nThis
    module is a reference to the song \"Wavetapper\" by Frums, and its background
    animation. I highly suggest you check it out, since it's easily accessible on
    YouTube. And who knows, you might find some references in the manual you may not
    have noticed before watching it.\n\nOriginal idea made by: Lumbud84\n\nmoduleID:
